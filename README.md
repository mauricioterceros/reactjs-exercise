Fetch from this API endpoint: https://random-data-api.com/api/users/random_user?size=10

This will return ten random users.

After fetching the data from API endpoint:
- Store it in React state.
- Show each user's basic info in a card.
  - Render the data based on the state.
- Optional: Add a button to refresh data from API

Hints:
- Do the fetching inside a useEffect React hook
- Create a custom component for the card, which accepts a user JSON object. Map through the data returned from the API and render each one using the custom component.
